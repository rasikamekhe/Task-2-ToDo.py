In this task, I created a console-based To-Do List manager using Python.
It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, while saving them permanently in a text file for future use.
The application uses lists, file handling, functions, loops, and conditionals for smooth operation.

ğŸ”¹ What the Code Does

Uses a list to store all tasks temporarily during execution.
Reads and writes tasks to a file (tasks.txt) using open() for data persistence.

Implements functions like:

> load_tasks() â€“ loads existing tasks from file.

> save_tasks() â€“ saves tasks to file.

> view_tasks() â€“ displays all tasks.

> add_task() â€“ adds new tasks.

> remove_task() â€“ deletes selected tasks.

ğŸ”¹ Displays a menu using a loop to let users choose options repeatedly.

ğŸ”¹ Handles invalid input and missing files safely using try-except.

ğŸ”¹ Saves all changes automatically before exiting.
